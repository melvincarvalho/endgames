# Basic Checkmates

These checkmates are the foundation of endgame play. You cannot improve at chess without mastering them.

## Why Learn Basic Checkmates?

1. **They appear in every game** where you win material
2. **Time pressure** — you need to execute quickly and confidently
3. **Foundation** — advanced endgames often reduce to these positions

## The Essential Four

| Checkmate | Difficulty | Moves Required |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| [King + Queen vs King](/fundamentals/basic-checkmates/queen-mate) | Beginner | ~10 moves |
| [King + Rook vs King](/fundamentals/basic-checkmates/rook-mate) | Beginner | ~16 moves |
| [King + Two Bishops vs King](/fundamentals/basic-checkmates/two-bishops-mate) | Intermediate | ~18 moves |
| [King + Bishop + Knight vs King](/fundamentals/basic-checkmates/bishop-knight-mate) | Advanced | ~33 moves |

## Common Mistakes

### Stalemate

The #1 beginner mistake. Always ensure the enemy king has a legal move unless you're delivering checkmate.

### Taking Too Long

With K+Q vs K, you have 50 moves. With K+R vs K, you have 50 moves. But in practice, you should be able to deliver mate in under 20-30 moves. Taking longer wastes time and can lead to errors.

### Wrong Technique

Each checkmate has a method. Random moves won't work—learn the technique.

## Practice Recommendations

1. **Set up the position** and practice against a friend or engine
2. **Time yourself** — aim for quick, confident execution
3. **Practice from different starting positions** — the king can start anywhere

## 50-Move Rule

Remember: if 50 moves pass without a pawn move or capture, the game is drawn. This is rarely an issue with basic checkmates, but becomes relevant with Bishop + Knight.
