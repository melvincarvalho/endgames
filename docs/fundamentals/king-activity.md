# King Activity

<span className="badge badge--must-know">Must Know</span>

In the middlegame, the king hides. In the endgame, the king fights.

## The Principle

> "The king is a strong piece. Use it!" — Reuben Fine

With fewer pieces on the board, the king becomes:
- A strong attacker (worth ~4 pawns in activity)
- Essential for supporting passed pawns
- Often the decisive factor

## Centralization

The most important concept: **bring your king to the center**.

### Before

<ChessBoard fen="8/5pk1/5p1p/8/8/5P1P/5PK1/8 w - - 0 1" />

Both kings are passive. First one to centralize gains advantage.

### After

<ChessBoard fen="8/5pk1/5p1p/4K3/8/5P1P/5P2/8 b - - 0 1" />

White's king reached e5 first. This is winning.

## When to Activate

Activate your king when:

1. **Queens are off** — No back-rank mate threats
2. **Few pieces remain** — Less tactical danger
3. **Endgame is approaching** — Even with queens, start thinking about king position

## King Paths

Plan your king's journey. The shortest path isn't always best—sometimes you need to avoid checks.

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/4k3/8/4K3/8/8 w - - 0 1" />

To reach c5, the king can go:
- e3-d3-c3-c4-c5 (5 moves, might allow opposition)
- e3-d4-c5 (3 moves via diagonal)

**Diagonal paths** often save tempi.

## King Infiltration

Once centralized, look for infiltration points—squares where your king can invade the enemy position.

<ChessBoard fen="8/5pk1/5p1p/8/4K3/5P1P/5P2/8 w - - 0 1" />

White's king can infiltrate via d5-c6 or f5-g6, attacking Black's pawns.

## The "Rule" of the King

In endgames:

1. **Bring the king to the center immediately**
2. **Support your passed pawns** with the king
3. **Attack enemy weaknesses** with the king
4. **Don't leave the king passive** while your opponent's king dominates

## King vs Passed Pawn

The king is crucial for both promotion and prevention.

### Escorting a Pawn

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/8/3PK3/8/8/4k3 w - - 0 1" />

The king in front of and beside the pawn is ideal. **Kd5**, then march the pawn.

### Stopping a Pawn

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/4p3/8/8/6K1/8 w - - 0 1" />

White's king must reach the queening square (e1). **Kf2!** heads toward the pawn.

## Practice Position

<ChessBoard fen="8/p4k2/1p6/1P6/P7/8/5K2/8 w - - 0 1" />

Where should White's king go?

**Ke3!** heading for c4 or d5. The king must attack Black's pawns while Black's king is far away. White wins by capturing the a7 pawn.

## Summary

1. The king is a fighting piece in endgames
2. Centralize your king early in the endgame
3. Use diagonal paths to save time
4. Support your pawns and attack enemy pawns
5. An active king can be worth a pawn
