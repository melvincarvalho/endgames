# Pawn Endgame Principles

<span className="badge badge--beginner">Beginner</span>

Pawn endgames are "the endgame of endgames." Master these principles.

## Core Concepts

1. **King activity** — The king is the star of pawn endgames
2. **Opposition** — The fundamental tool for king battles
3. **Key squares** — Control these and the pawn promotes
4. **Pawn structure** — Passed pawns, connected pawns, isolated pawns

## The Golden Rule

> "Pawn endings are to chess what putting is to golf."
> — Cecil Purdy

A single tempo can decide the game. Calculate precisely.

## Study Order

1. [King + Pawn vs King](/pawn-endgames/king-pawn-vs-king) — The foundation
2. [Rule of the Square](/pawn-endgames/rule-of-the-square) — Can the king catch the pawn?
3. [Opposition (Deep)](/pawn-endgames/opposition-deep) — Advanced applications
4. [Triangulation](/pawn-endgames/triangulation) — Gaining tempi
