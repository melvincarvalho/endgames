# King + Pawn vs King

The most important endgame. You will play this hundreds of times.

## The Critical Questions

1. **Can the pawn promote?**
2. **Where is the attacking king?**
3. **Who has the opposition?**

## Winning Conditions

The attacking side wins if the king can reach a **key square** in front of the pawn.

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/8/3k4/8/3PK3/8 w - - 0 1" />

White's goal: reach c4, d4, or e4 (key squares for the d2 pawn).

## The Rule: King in Front

> If your king is **in front** of your pawn with room to advance, you usually win.

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/3k4/8/3K4/3P4/8 w - - 0 1" />

White has the king in front. After **Ke4**, White wins with proper technique.

## Drawing Zones

The defender draws if they can keep their king in front of the pawn or reach opposition.

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/3k4/8/8/3PK3/8 b - - 0 1" />

Black to move: **...Kd4!** (opposition) and Black holds.

## The Rook Pawn Problem

Rook pawns (a-file, h-file) are special. The edge limits the king's movement.

<ChessBoard fen="8/8/8/k7/8/K7/P7/8 w - - 0 1" />

This is **drawn** even with White's king in front! Black's king reaches the corner and cannot be expelled.

## Practice Positions

Know these patterns:

| Position | Result |
|----------|--------|
| King in front, room to advance | Win |
| King behind pawn | Usually draw |
| Rook pawn, defender reaches corner | Draw |

## Summary

1. Get your king in front of your pawn
2. Control the key squares
3. Use opposition to gain ground
4. Beware of rook pawns—they often draw
