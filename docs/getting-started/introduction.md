# Introduction to Chess Endgames

> "In order to improve your game, you must study the endgame before everything else." — José Raúl Capablanca

## Why Study Endgames?

The endgame is where games are won and lost. Many players focus on openings and tactics, but neglect this critical phase. Here's why endgame study pays dividends:

1. **Practical results**: Converting a won position requires technique. Without endgame knowledge, advantages slip away.

2. **Improved calculation**: Endgames have fewer pieces, making them ideal for training precise calculation.

3. **Strategic understanding**: Endgame principles (king activity, pawn structure, piece coordination) apply throughout the game.

4. **Confidence**: Knowing you can convert advantages removes pressure in the middlegame.

## How This Guide Is Organized

We offer multiple ways to navigate the material:

| Approach | Best For |
|----------|----------|
| [Study Paths](/study-paths/overview) | Progressive learning by rating level |
| [By Material](/pawn-endgames/principles) | Looking up specific endgame types |
| [Strategic Themes](/strategic-themes/overview) | Understanding cross-cutting concepts |

## Difficulty Levels

Each position is tagged with a difficulty level:

- 🟢 **Beginner** (under 1200) — Basic patterns everyone must know
- 🟡 **Intermediate** (1200-1600) — Standard theoretical positions
- 🟠 **Advanced** (1600-2000) — Complex positions requiring deeper understanding
- 🔴 **Master** (2000+) — Subtle positions, exceptions, and rare patterns

Positions marked **Must Know** are fundamental—you should be able to play these correctly without thinking.

## Getting Started

We recommend starting with:

1. [Basic Checkmates](/fundamentals/basic-checkmates/overview) — The foundation of all endgames
2. [King + Pawn vs King](/pawn-endgames/king-pawn-vs-king) — The most important endgame
3. [The Lucena Position](/rook-endgames/lucena-position) — Essential rook endgame technique

## Using the Chess Viewer

- View the position
- See the FEN string for analysis in your own tools
- Some positions include embedded Lichess studies for move-by-move analysis
