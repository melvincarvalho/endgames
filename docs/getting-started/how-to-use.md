# How to Use This Guide

## Study Approaches

### Progressive Study (Recommended for Improvement)

Follow the [Study Paths](/study-paths/overview) matched to your rating:

1. Start at your current level
2. Master each position before moving on
3. Review periodically to retain knowledge
4. Advance to the next level when comfortable

### Reference Lookup

Use the material-based sections when you need to:

- Prepare for a specific endgame type
- Analyze a position from your own games
- Understand a position you encountered

### Thematic Study

Explore [Strategic Themes](/strategic-themes/overview) to understand concepts that apply across multiple endgame types.

## Active Learning Tips

### 1. Set Up the Position

Don't just read—use a physical board or software to:

- Play through the main line
- Try alternative moves and understand why they fail
- Practice against an engine

### 2. Understand, Don't Memorize

Focus on **why** moves work, not just the moves themselves. Understanding principles lets you handle variations.

### 3. Test Yourself

Cover the solution and try to find the winning method. Only then check your answer.

### 4. Spaced Repetition

Return to positions after days or weeks. Long-term retention requires periodic review.

### 5. Analyze Your Games

When your games reach an endgame, analyze it thoroughly. Did you know the correct technique? What could you improve?
