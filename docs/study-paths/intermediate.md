## 1. Rook Endgame Essentials

Rook endgames are the most common endgame type. Two positions are absolutely essential:

### The Lucena Position

**The winning technique when your pawn is on the 7th rank.**

If you reach a Lucena-type position with a rook and pawn vs rook, you must know how to win. The technique is called "building a bridge."

### The Philidor Position

**The drawing technique when defending.**

When your opponent has a rook and pawn, and your king is in front of the pawn, this position shows how to hold the draw.

## 2. Advanced Pawn Endgame Techniques

### Triangulation

Sometimes you need to "lose a tempo" to put your opponent in zugzwang. Triangulation is the technique of maneuvering your king in a triangle to achieve this.

### Outside Passed Pawn

An outside passed pawn is a powerful advantage. It diverts the enemy king, allowing yours to win material on the other side of the board.

## 3. King Activity

The king is a fighting piece in the endgame. Understanding when and how to activate your king is crucial.

**Principle**: In the endgame, the king belongs in the center of the action, not hiding in the corner.
