# Beginner Path (Under 1200)

Master these fundamentals before moving on. These positions appear constantly in games at all levels.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this path, you will be able to:

- ✅ Checkmate with King + Queen vs King
- ✅ Checkmate with King + Rook vs King
- ✅ Know when King + Pawn vs King wins or draws
- ✅ Understand and use the opposition

---

## 1. Basic Checkmates

### King + Queen vs King

The easiest checkmate. Learn to drive the enemy king to the edge without stalemate.

**Key technique**: Use the queen to restrict the king, then bring your king to help deliver mate.

### King + Rook vs King

Slightly more technical. Requires understanding of "building a box."

**Key technique**: Cut off the enemy king with your rook, push it to the edge, then checkmate.

## 2. King + Pawn vs King

The most important endgame. You will encounter this hundreds of times in your chess career.

### Critical Questions

1. Can the pawn promote?
2. Can the defending king stop it?
3. Where should the attacking king be?

### Key Concepts

- **The Rule of the Square** — Can the king catch the pawn?
- **The Opposition** — Who has to move loses
- **Key Squares** — Control these and the pawn promotes
