# Advanced Path (1600-2000)

Deepen your understanding with complex positions, exceptions, and strategic themes.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you've mastered:

- ✅ [Beginner Path](/study-paths/beginner) — Checkmates, basic K+P vs K
- ✅ [Intermediate Path](/study-paths/intermediate) — Lucena, Philidor, triangulation

---

## Learning Objectives

By completing this path, you will be able to:

- ✅ Evaluate Bishop vs Knight endings
- ✅ Understand opposite-color bishop dynamics
- ✅ Recognize and build fortresses
- ✅ Apply the principle of two weaknesses
- ✅ Know when NOT to hurry

---

## 1. Minor Piece Endgames

### Bishop vs Knight

Neither piece is universally superior—the position determines which is better.

**Bishop is better when**:
- Open position with pawns on both flanks
- Passed pawn needs support from distance

**Knight is better when**:
- Closed position
- Pawns are fixed on one color
- Outpost squares available

### Opposite-Color Bishops

These endings have strong drawing tendencies, but are not automatic draws. Understanding when the attacker wins is critical.

## 2. Strategic Themes

### Fortresses

A fortress is a defensive setup that cannot be broken despite material disadvantage. Recognizing fortress possibilities can save lost positions.

### The Principle of Two Weaknesses

Against a single weakness, the defender can hold. Creating a second weakness stretches the defense and often wins.

### Do Not Hurry

In endgames with a clear advantage, patience is key. Premature action can throw away wins.

## 3. Complex Rook Endgames

Beyond Lucena and Philidor, rook endgames have many nuances:

- Rook + 2 pawns vs Rook + pawn
- Rook vs Rook with pawns on both flanks
- Active vs passive rook positions
