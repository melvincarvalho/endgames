# Rook Endgame Principles

<span className="badge badge--intermediate">Intermediate</span>

Rook endgames are the most common endgame type. Master these principles before studying specific positions.

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Activate Your Rook

> "Rooks belong behind passed pawns—yours or your opponent's."

A rook behind a passed pawn:
- **Your pawn**: Rook supports its advance, gaining space
- **Opponent's pawn**: Rook restricts its advance

### 2. Cut Off the Enemy King

Use your rook to cut off the enemy king from the action—by file or by rank.

### 3. King Activity Matters

The king is crucial. Centralize it and use it actively.

### 4. The 7th Rank Is Powerful

A rook on the 7th rank attacks pawns and restricts the king.

### 5. Passed Pawns Must Be Pushed

Don't let passed pawns sit idle. Push them when possible.

## The Two Critical Positions

Before studying complex rook endgames, you **must** know:

| Position | Situation | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| [Lucena](/rook-endgames/lucena-position) | Pawn on 7th, king in front | Win |
| [Philidor](/rook-endgames/philidor-position) | Defending against pawn on 6th | Draw |

These positions are the foundation. Every rook endgame player must know them cold.

## Rook Placement

### Behind the Passed Pawn

Best position in most cases.

### On the 7th Rank

Attacks pawns, restricts king.

### Cutting Off the King

By file or rank, limiting the king's activity.

### Passive Defense

Usually bad. Avoid passive rook positions when possible.

## Common Themes

| Third Rank Defense | Philidor technique for drawing |
| Checking Distance | Rook needs space to give checks |
| Pawn Race | When both sides push passed pawns |
